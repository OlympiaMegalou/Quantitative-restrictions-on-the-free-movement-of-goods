# Quantitative Restrictions on the Free Movement of Goods

This project explores the concept of **quantitative restrictions on the free movement of goods** within the framework of **European Union law**, a core component of the Internal Market.

## Overview

This study analyzes:
- The **development and significance of the Internal Market**, tracing its evolution from the Common Market.
- The **four fundamental freedoms** of the EU: free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital.
- The principle of **equal treatment** and its application across member states.

## Main Topics

### 1. Internal Market
- Defined as an area without internal borders for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people.
- Historical evolution through major treaties (*Rome*, *Maastricht*, *Lisbon*).
- Various stages of **economic integration**:
  - Free Trade Area
  - Customs Union
  - Common Market
  - Economic Union

### 2. Free Movement of Goods
- Elimination of:
  - **Tariffs**
  - **Tax discrimination**
  - **Non-tariff barriers**
- **Quantitative restrictions** and **measures having equivalent effect (MEQRs)** are prohibited under **Articles 34â€“35 TFEU**.
- **Exceptions** are permitted under **Article 36** (e.g., public health, morality, or national heritage).

### 3. Key Legal Concepts
- **Goods**: Defined as products with commercial value.
- **Monopolies and technical regulations**: Monitored closely to prevent market distortion.
- Case law such as *Dassonville* and *Cassis de Dijon* helped shape core legal standards.

## Conclusion

The **free movement of goods** is not only a legal principle but a key driver of EU economic integration. Despite progress, challenges persist due to evolving political, economic, and technological environments.
